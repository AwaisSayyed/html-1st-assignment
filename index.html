Comments in HTML are used to provide explanations or notes within the code. They are not displayed on the webpage. You
can use <!-- to start a comment and --> to end it. For example:
<!-- This is a comment. It won't be displayed on the webpage. -->

Here's an HTML program that includes a heading, a paragraph of text, a horizontal line, and a line break arranged to
create a simple webpage layout:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Layout Example</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <hr> <!-- Horizontal line -->
    <br> <!-- Line break -->
</body>

</html>

A "Tag" in HTML is a specific keyword or code used to define an element within the document. An "Element" consists of an
opening tag, content, and a closing tag. For example:
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
In this example, <p> is the opening tag, This is a paragraph element. is the content, and </p> is the closing tag.

The DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML, often written as
<!DOCTYPE html>, is used to specify the document type and version of HTML being used. It informs the web browser about
the rules and specifications to be followed when rendering the webpage. In modern HTML,
<!DOCTYPE html> is used to indicate that the document follows the HTML5 standard. It should typically appear at the very
beginning of an HTML document.

It helps ensure consistent rendering across different browsers and tells the browser that the document is an HTML5
document.
